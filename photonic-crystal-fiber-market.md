<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photonic-crystal Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Index-Guiding Fibers</li><li>Photonic Bandgap (Air Guiding) Fibers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photonic-crystal fiber market is primarily categorized into two types: index-guiding fibers and photonic bandgap (air-guiding) fibers. Index-guiding fibers utilize a core with a higher refractive index than the surrounding cladding to confine light, enabling efficient transmission. In contrast, photonic bandgap fibers manipulate light through a microstructured cladding that creates a photonic bandgap, allowing for guidance by reflecting certain wavelengths while permitting others. These distinct mechanisms cater to varied applications in telecommunications, sensing, and medical technologies.</p></p>
