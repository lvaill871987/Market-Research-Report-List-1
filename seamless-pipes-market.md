<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seamless Pipes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot-rolled</li><li>Cold-rolled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The seamless pipes market can be categorized into two main types: hot-rolled and cold-rolled pipes. Hot-rolled seamless pipes are produced by heating metal above its recrystallization temperature, resulting in a robust and ductile product ideal for high-temperature applications. In contrast, cold-rolled seamless pipes are manufactured at room temperature, offering a smoother finish and tighter tolerances, making them suitable for precise applications in industries like oil and gas and automotive. Both types cater to specific structural and operational requirements.</p></p>
